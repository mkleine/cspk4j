CSPK4J, CSP kernel for Java
Moritz Kleine, mkleine at cs tu-berlin de

The CSPK4J framework offers CSP concurrency for Java. It supports a
subset of CSPm [FDR] according to CSPk4J.g (ANTLR v3 grammar).

The semantics behind the CSPK4J framework ist described in

    Moritz Kleine and J W Sanders. Simulating truly concurrent CSP.

Requirements

Java > 1.5
ANTLR 3.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the Examples

Assuming that the CSPK4J framework and antlr 3.2 are on your
classpath,

>java org.cspk4j.example.InteractiveConsoleExampleRunner

lets you choose one of the built-in examples and runs them. The
"semaphore" example is the example application described in
 
   Moritz Kleine and Steffen Helke. Low-Level Code Veriﬁcation Based
   on CSP Models. Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods (SBMF 2009).

The following command launches the CSPm script with the default
example configuration:

> java org.cspk4j.example.ScriptExampleRunner

Note that only single-operator processes are supported and that the
CSPm Skript must not contain any functional parts.

CSPK4J Workflow Server Prototype

A Workflow Server protoype serves as case study for CSPK4J. It is
presented in

    Moritz Kleine and Thomas Göthel. Specification, Verification and
    Implementation of Business Processes using CSP. 4th IEEE 
    International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software 
    Engineering (TASE 2010).

The zip file contains the necessary jars in the output directory. Two
example process definitions reside in the tmp directory. The launch
script must be adjusted so that FDR can be found, otherwise the 
workflow server won't start.
